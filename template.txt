Dear Dr. Schlissel,

As a [student/faculty member/staff member/alumn(a)] of the university, I have been repeatedly disappointed to see your responses to ongoing crises in the state of Michigan and in the U.S. at large.

You respond to pressures to keep students safely at home with a tuition increase and an insistence on re-opening the campus. You open campus knowing that this virus will be nearly impossible to contain. And despite so desperately wanting to re-open the campus, you refuse to implement regular testing that could prevent the spread of a deadly disease. 

You then go on to speak in a faculty town hall about how if frequent testing is mandated, students will use negative results as excuses to gather and recklessly and endanger others. You use the HIV/AIDS epidemic as an analogy, falsely blaming the spread of the disease on people (primarily gay men) who had sex after receiving negative test results. In both cases your logic is flawed. Community members cannot effectively protect themselves from diseases when people in power— not to mention medical doctors and researchers like yourself— discount the value of testing, downplay the severity of a crisis, and deny people information and prophylactic measures. 

Just as public officials failed to act during the HIV/AIDS crisis, you and other officials today fail to act. You fail to make appropriate preventative decisions, you fail to spread correct information about testing and prophylaxis, and you use victims as scapegoats for your own failures. Both you and those officials during the ‘80s and ‘90s are responsible for continued misinformation, continued homophobia, and continued deaths.

The UM community demands that you apologize for perpetuating homophobic myths about the HIV/AIDS crisis. We also demand that you implement regular testing and improved precautionary measures, or move the semester online as many wiser universities have done.

Sincerely,
